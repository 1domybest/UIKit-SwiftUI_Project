I initially created the project using Storyboards and implemented basic navigation using a UINavigationController.
To integrate SwiftUI,
I used UIHostingController to embed SwiftUI views within the UINavigationController, 
allowing seamless use of both frameworks together. The project is designed to leverage Storyboards and SwiftUI simultaneously.
